# Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition
This repository contains a Python project for Automatic Number Plate Recognition using OpenCV for image processing and EasyOCR for text extraction.

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required libraries: OpenCV, EasyOCR. You can install them using pip:
      pip install opencv-python , 
      pip install easyocr

How it Works
  1. Webcam Feed: The script captures frames from your webcam in real-time.
  2. Preprocessing: Preprocessing techniques are applied to enhance the visibility of the number plate in each frame.
  3. Number Plate Detection: A Haar Cascade Classifier is used for number plate detection in each frame, which involves applying a pre-trained model to locate the plate's region.
  4. Text Recognition: EasyOCR is employed to recognize the text on the number plate in real-time.
